        "\n",
        "Gas Natural, a leading gas and electricity utility serving corporate, SME, and residential customers, faces increased customer churn in the SME sector due to energy market liberalization in Europe. Collaborating with our company, they aim to identify the key factors driving SME customer churn.\n",
        "\n",
        "An initial hypothesis suggests that price changes play a pivotal role in customer churn. To address this, a predictive model could prove beneficial in pinpointing customers more likely to churn at their current price levels.\n",
        "\n",
        "For high-risk customers identified through the model, offering a substantial 20% discount is being considered by the head of the SME division. This discount is anticipated to serve as a compelling incentive for customers, particularly those for whom pricing is a primary concern, to stay with Gas Natural.\n",
        "\n",
        "The project team believes there is promise in constructing a churn model to ascertain whether price sensitivity holds the most significant influence on customer turnover. The client has provided data and have tasked you with conducting the analysis.\n",
